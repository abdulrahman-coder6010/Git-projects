            <p> But not only does he (the school system) makes fish climb trees, but also makes them climb down and do it (10 mile) run </p>
            <p> Tell me school are you proud of the things you've done, Turning millions of people into robots. Do you find that fun? </p>
            <p>Do you realise how many kids related to that fish swimming upstream in class never finding there gifts thinking they're stupid beliving they're usless?</p>
            <p>I accuse school of killing creativity, individuality and being intellectually abusive.</p>

        <p> let me ask a question. Are we preparing students to the future or the past. I the past schools were made to train people to work in factories</p>
        <p> which explains why you put students in straight roles nice and neat tell them sit still raise your hand if you want to speak give them a short break to eat and for 8 hours a day tell them what to think. and let them compete to get an [A]. <mark>A letter which determines product quality hits grade A of meat.</mark></p>
        <p>But today we don't need to make robot-zombies. The world has progressed and now we need people who think creatively, innovatively, critically, independently with the ability to connect. </p>
        <p>But if a doctor prescribed the exact same medicine to all of his patients The results would be tragic; so many people would get sick yet when it comes to school this is exactly what happens. This educational malpractice.</p>
        <p>where one teacher stands in front of 20 children each one having different strengths different needs different gifts different dreams and you teach the same thing the same way, that's horrific.</p>
        <p>This may be one of the worst criminal offenses ever to be committed.</p>
